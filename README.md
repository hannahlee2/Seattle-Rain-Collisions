## Project Description:
The city of Seattle probably makes you think about a few things: Starbucks, rainy weather, and popular tourist attractions, like the Space Needle. This got us wondering what potential relationships we may uncover about Seattle using data like weather, collisions, and population metrics.
The objective of this project is to detemine any relationships between the variables in our datasets and use logistic regression to predict the severity of a collision. 

## Datasets:
The datasets we will be using are `Observed Monthly Rain Gauge Accumulations - Oct 2002 to May 2017`, which records monthly accumulations of rain gauges located throughout Seattle city limits, the `SDOT Collisions - All Years`, which records the number of collisions in Seattle (provided by SPD and recorded by Traffic Records), and the `City Annual Stats`, which includes the total population (and change in population), housing, and jobs for the City of Seattle for each calendar year.
